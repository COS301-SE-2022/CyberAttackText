 <h3> <b> Project Description </b> </h3>
 <p> My role is to build a Cyber-Attack reporting system that will be responsible for allowing users to report cyber-attack crimes anonymously. The system will collect text data from user reports, social media platforms, web scraping, scam emails or documents from the victims of the cyber-attacks. The system will be able to visualise the collected text data and the diversity of the data that has been collected. Sentiment analysis services will be employed in the system from the collected text data and this will then be used to determine if a conversation can lead to potential cyber attack lures. The sentiment analysis services will then be able to be used by any digital forensic investigator software application.  </p>
